	Web interface updates: 
	  * If the RAD tags are aligned to a reference genome, a filter is now available to view markers
	    from a particular genomic region.
	  * The individual RAD tag viewer now scrolls while keeping the scale view and consensus sequence
	    always visible. 
	  * The RAD tag viewer now highlights columns for which the catalog locus shows a SNP, but the
	    RAD tag does not.
	  * In the genotype viewer, the map between the haplotype and genotype is now available.
	  * The depth of each RAD tag is now visible in the genotype viewer.
	  * The genotype viewer has now been integrated with the observed haplotype viewer. You can 
	    make changes/corrections to genotypes directly now, no need to submit a form and wait for 
	    the page to reload.
	Bugfix: process_radtags wasn't properly parsing the names of v1 Illumnina BUSTARD files.

Stacks 0.995 - September 23, 2011
---------------------------------
	Feature: sstacks can now handle samples and catalogs that have different length reads. 
	Each individual sample must be constructed from the same length reads (by ustacks and cstacks),
	but between samples there can be different lengths, e.g. a catalog of length 50bp and samples 
	of length 100bp, or vice versa.
	Feature: Added the ApeKI restriction enzyme to process_radtags
	Feature: process_radtags can now capture discarded reads to a file.
	Bugfix: a coding limitation was removed that required polymorphic sites in the catalog to 
	contain only two alleles. Now, all four alleles can be recorded at a single site in a locus in
	the catalog.
	Bugfix: Exporting results from the web interface was not including manual genotype corrections 
	when requested.

Stacks 0.994 - August 08, 2011
------------------------------
	Feature: added catalog index structure to cstacks to speed construction of catalog
	when using reference-aligned sequences.
	Feature: added a new output type, 'genomic' to genotypes. Outputs SNPs individually,
	encoded as a set of integers, for reference-aligned reads.
	Bugfix: pstacks was not writing individual stack sequences properly.
	Bugfix: process_radtags was still checking the quality of sequence that was 
	destined to be truncated off the read.
	Bugfix: process_radtags segfault fixed, parsing stop position
	mis-specified in parse_input_record().

Stacks 0.993 - August 05, 2011
------------------------------
	Memory usage optimization: Individual sequence reads are now stored internally 
	using a 2-bit encoding of DNA nucleotides. Some simple benchmarking of 
	ustacks (previous version / new version):

	 Sample size         Elapsed Time       Used Memory
	-------------     -----------------    -------------
	 3.78m reads         3:16 /    3:23     4.64G /  1.86G
	17.62m reads      1:31:21 / 1:43:54    55.55G / 45.42G

	Feature: Added the programs sort_read_pairs.pl, exec_velvet.pl, load_sequences.pl
	to facilitate the assembly of paired-end RAD-Tags into mini-contigs and allow them
	to be uploaded into and viewed from the web interface.
	Bugfix: made process_radtags emit an error when an unrecognized
	restriction enzyme is specified.
	Bugfix: made process_radtags accept barcodes with trailing whitespace,
	such as would be seen in a DOS text file or if errant tabs are
	specified.

Stacks 0.992 - July 04, 2011
----------------------------
	Feature: process_radtags can now handle Phred+33 or Phred+64 encodings, Phred+33 is
	the new default encoding in Illumina's CASAVA software (v1.8).
	Bugfix: Changed the sql input parser to handle variable length input
	lines. Necessary if loading tens of individuals into a catalog.
	Bugfix: Added command line options to ustacks to better control the use of secondary reads 
	in the stack-building procedure.

Stacks 0.991 - June 06, 2011
----------------------------
	Bugfix: genotypes was failing to parse Stacks output files with
	unanticipated names.
	Bugfix: when using ref_map.pl, tags without SNPs were failing to match
	against the catalog.

Stacks 0.99 - May 20, 2011
--------------------------
	*A new C++ genotypes program has been added. This program works independently from the 
	database allowing the pipeline to fully function without installing the database. The
	new program performs the tasks once completed by markers.pl and genotypes.pl.
	    - The pipeline has been modified to now automatically execute the genotypes program
	      as the last stage in an analysis. It will generate a file containing the observed
	      haplotypes and an additional file containing a map-agnostic set of genotype calls.
	    - If SQL interaction is enabled, the genotypes will be imported to the database and 
	      serve as a base to export genotypes directly from the web interface for a particular
	      map and using the set of filters available online.
	    - If a population is being examinined, the observed haplotypes file can be imported into
	      Microsoft Excel or another tab-separated file viewer to immediately see the results.
	    - By replacing the Perl version of genotypes.pl we also no longer need to install or 
	      worry about the caching mechanism for auto-correcting stacks, the C++ version can do
	      this by directly reading the Stacks output files.
	*markers.pl and genotypes.pl are now deprecated and will no longer be supported.
	*Feature: When exporting observed haplotypes, you can now specify a
	minimum stack depth to include a particular individual at a locus.
	*Feature: map-specific genotypes can now be exported directly from the
	database/web server.
	*Bugfix: genotypes.pl: make script ignore parental genotypes based on
	the sample type from the MySQL table, not based on the file name.
	*Bugfix: genotypes.pl: some loci were sneaking in despite being under
	the progeny limit.
	*Bugfix: made process_radtags Bustard file parser check number of fields to prevent
	attempting to parse FASTQ (and segfaulting). Thanks to
	Maureen.Liu -at- nottingham.ac.uk for reporting it.
	*Bugfix: in sstacks, when matching to the catalog using reads aligned
	to a reference genome (-g), sstacks did not verify that haplotypes
	matched exactly, causing some spurious matching, which later
	translated into dropped genotypes.
	*Bugfix: in markers.pl, the ratio observed alleles in the progeny was
	not being tallied correctly for ab/ac markers.

Stacks 0.984 - May 04, 2011
---------------------------
	*Bugfix: renamed constants.php to constants.php.dist to avoid
	overwriting an existing file on reinstallation.
	*Feature: process_radtags has been converted to a C++ program
	increasing its speed by approximately 25x. The parameters were
	modified to be a little more intuitive and parameters were added to
	control the size and score limit of the sliding window. The program
	can process a GAII lane in about 5 minutes, a HiSeq lane in about 12
	minutes, depending on the hardware used.

Stacks 0.983 - Apr 30, 2011
---------------------------
	*Bugfix: sstacks segfault when running parallelized. Improper
	insertion into map object when it should have only been checking for
	element presence/absence. Thanks to <yannick -dot- wurm -at- unil -dot- ch>
	for first reporting it.
	*Feature: added code to impute the genotype of a missing, second
	parent for some map types. This code adds up all the observed
	haplotypes in the progeny and then compares their frequencies against
	those that would be expected for the marker under Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium, choosing the marker type that best fits the
	Hardy-Weinberg expectation.

Stacks 0.982 - Mar 29, 2011
---------------------------
	*Bugfix: process_radtags.pl was not properly parsing FASTQ formated,
	 paired-end file names.
	*Bugfix: counts of matching parents/progeny were sometimes incorrect
	 due to a slightly promiscuous SQL query in index_radtags.pl.

Stacks 0.98 - Feb 25, 2011
---------------------------
        Note: if you have pre-existing databases, you must rebuild the catalog
	index (index_radtags.pl -D db -c) so that they are compatible with 
	the new elements of the web interface.

	*Added option to pstacks to require a minimum depth of coverage for 
	 a stack aligned to the refernce genome before reporting it.
	*Added double haploid (DH) and F2 export types to the genotypes.pl
	 script.
	*Added option to output any map in R/QTL output in genotypes.pl
	*Added feature to filter by number of available genotypes in progeny
	*Added command line option to ustacks to capture and output unused
         reads.
	*Added display of chromosome/base pair to web interface for stacks 
	 aligned to a reference genome.
	*Bugfix: FASTA parser was missing records due to a bug introduced from
	 a FASTQ parser fix.
	*Bugfix: process_radtags.pl was not properly checking the integrity of 
	 the RAD site after adding restriction enzymes with alternate
	 nucleotides.
	*Bugfix: when constructing the catalog, some tags being added to the
	 did not have their genomic location transferred over to a new catalog 
	 tag.
	*Modified sstacks to include an option to match stacks against the
	 catalog based on the genomic location (assuming individuals were
	 processed with pstacks).
        *Bugfix: Lots of clean-ups and command line option fixes, thanks 
	 to <yannick -dot- wurm -at- unil -dot- ch>.

Stacks 0.971 - Jan 30, 2011
---------------------------
	*Illumina software version 1.3 produces Phred scores that can begin 
	 with a '@' character, throwing off the FASTQ parser. Added code to 
	 clear the read buffer in between records to solve the problem. Thanks 
	 to Aarti <aartiv -at- uchicago -dot- edu> for finding the bug.

Stacks 0.97
---------------------------
	*ustacks now detects when there are uncalled nucleotides in FASTA or 
	 FASTQ input files, replaces those bases with 'A'.
	*process_radtags.pl now detects barcode length automatically. Removed 
	 spurious error messages when no data is processed.

Stacks 0.96 - Jan 7, 2011
---------------------------
	*Fixed typo in README giving the wrong file path for the Apache 
	 configuration file.
	*Fixed several hard-coded paths in PHP files that referred to our local 
	 system.
