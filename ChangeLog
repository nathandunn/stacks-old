	*Bugfix: in sstacks, when matching to the catalog using reads aligned
	to a reference genome (-g), sstacks did not verify that haplotypes
	matched exactly, causing some spurious matching, which later
	translated into dropped genotypes. 
	*Bugfix: in markers.pl, the ratio observed alleles in the progeny was
	not being tallied correctly for ab/ac markers.

Stacks 0.984 - May 04, 2011
---------------------------
	*Bugfix: renamed constants.php to constants.php.dist to avoid
	overwriting an existing file on reinstallation.
	*Feature: process_radtags has been converted to a C++ program
	increasing its speed by approximately 25x. The parameters were
	modified to be a little more intuitive and parameters were added to
	control the size and score limit of the sliding window. The program
	can process a GAII lane in about 5 minutes, a HiSeq lane in about 12
	minutes, depending on the hardware used.

Stacks 0.983 - Apr 30, 2011
---------------------------
	*Bugfix: sstacks segfault when running parallelized. Improper
	insertion into map object when it should have only been checking for
	element presence/absence. Thanks to <yannick -dot- wurm -at- unil -dot- ch>
	for first reporting it.
	*Feature: added code to impute the genotype of a missing, second
	parent for some map types. This code adds up all the observed
	haplotypes in the progeny and then compares their frequencies against
	those that would be expected for the marker under Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium, choosing the marker type that best fits the
	Hardy-Weinberg expectation.

Stacks 0.982 - Mar 29, 2011
---------------------------
	*Bugfix: process_radtags.pl was not properly parsing FASTQ formated,
	 paired-end file names.
	*Bugfix: counts of matching parents/progeny were sometimes incorrect
	 due to a slightly promiscuous SQL query in index_radtags.pl.

Stacks 0.98 - Feb 25, 2011
---------------------------
        Note: if you have pre-existing databases, you must rebuild the catalog
	index (index_radtags.pl -D db -c) so that they are compatible with 
	the new elements of the web interface.

	*Added option to pstacks to require a minimum depth of coverage for 
	 a stack aligned to the refernce genome before reporting it.
	*Added double haploid (DH) and F2 export types to the genotypes.pl
	 script.
	*Added option to output any map in R/QTL output in genotypes.pl
	*Added feature to filter by number of available genotypes in progeny
	*Added command line option to ustacks to capture and output unused
         reads.
	*Added display of chromosome/base pair to web interface for stacks 
	 aligned to a reference genome.
	*Bugfix: FASTA parser was missing records due to a bug introduced from
	 a FASTQ parser fix.
	*Bugfix: process_radtags.pl was not properly checking the integrity of 
	 the RAD site after adding restriction enzymes with alternate
	 nucleotides.
	*Bugfix: when constructing the catalog, some tags being added to the
	 did not have their genomic location transferred over to a new catalog 
	 tag.
	*Modified sstacks to include an option to match stacks against the
	 catalog based on the genomic location (assuming individuals were
	 processed with pstacks).
        *Bugfix: Lots of clean-ups and command line option fixes, thanks 
	 to <yannick -dot- wurm -at- unil -dot- ch>.

Stacks 0.971 - Jan 30, 2011
---------------------------
	*Illumina software version 1.3 produces Phred scores that can begin 
	 with a '@' character, throwing off the FASTQ parser. Added code to 
	 clear the read buffer in between records to solve the problem. Thanks 
	 to Aarti <aartiv -at- uchicago -dot- edu> for finding the bug.

Stacks 0.97
---------------------------
	*ustacks now detects when there are uncalled nucleotides in FASTA or 
	 FASTQ input files, replaces those bases with 'A'.
	*process_radtags.pl now detects barcode length automatically. Removed 
	 spurious error messages when no data is processed.

Stacks 0.96 - Jan 7, 2011
---------------------------
	*Fixed typo in README giving the wrong file path for the Apache 
	 configuration file.
	*Fixed several hard-coded paths in PHP files that referred to our local 
	 system.
