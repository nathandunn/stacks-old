	*Bugfix: when constructing the catalog, some tags being added to the
	 did not have their genomic location transferred over to a new catalog 
	 tag.
	*Modified sstacks to include an option to match stacks against the
	 catalog based on the genomic location (assuming individuals were
	 processed with pstacks).
	*Added double haploid JoinMap export type (DH) to the genotypes.pl
	 script.

Stacks 0.971 - Jan 30, 2011
-------------------------
	*Illumina software version 1.3 produces Phred scores that can begin 
	 with a '@' character, throwing off the FASTQ parser. Added code to 
	 clear the read buffer in between records to solve the problem. Thanks 
	 to Aarti <aartiv -at- uchicago -dot- edu> for finding the bug.

Stacks 0.97
-------------------------
	*ustacks now detects when there are uncalled nucleotides in FASTA or 
	 FASTQ input files, replaces those bases with 'A'.
	*process_radtags.pl now detects barcode length automatically. Removed 
	 spurious error messages when no data is processed.

Stacks 0.96 - Jan 7, 2011
-------------------------
	*Fixed typo in README giving the wrong file path for the Apache 
	 configuration file.
	*Fixed several hard-coded paths in PHP files that referred to our local 
	 system.
