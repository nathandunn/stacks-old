1. Build the software. Stacks uses the standard autotools install:

% tar xfvz stacks_x.xx.tar.gz
% cd stacks_x.xx
% ./configure
% make
(become root)
# make install

You can change the root of the install location (/usr/local/ on most
operating systems) by specifying the --prefix command line option to
the configure script.

% ./configure --prefix=/home/smith/local

A default install will install files in the following way:

/usr/local/bin - stacks executables and perl scripts

/usr/local/share/stacks - PHP files for the web interface 
                          and SQL files for creating the 
                          MySQL database

/usr/local/var/stacks/cache - a directory for caching database 
                              results when exporting genotypes.

2. Edit the MySQL configuration file, installed in
/usr/local/share/stacks/sql/mysql.cnf.dist, to enable access to the
database from the Stacks scripts.

% cd /usr/local/share/stacks/
% cp mysql.cnf.dist mysql.cnf

Edit the file to reflect the proper username, password, and host to
use to access MySQL.

The various scripts that access the database will search for a MySQL
configuration file in your home directory before using the
Stacks-distributed copy. If you already have a personal account set up
and configured (in ~/.my.cnf) you can continue to use these
credentials instead of setting up new, common ones.

3. Enable the Stacks web interface in the Apache webserver.

Add a line to your apache configuration similar to: 

Alias /stacks "/usr/local/share/stacks/php"

Edit the PHP configuration file to allow it access to the MySQL
database. Change the constants.php file to include the proper database
username ($db_user), password ($db_pass), and hostname ($db_host).

You may find it advantageous to create a MySQL user with very limited
permissions - SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE to allow users to interact
with the database through the web interface.

4. Enable web-based exporting from the MySQL database.

Edit the stacks_export_notify.pl script to specify the email and SMTP
server to use in notification messages.

Ensure that the permissions of the php/export directory allow the
webserver to write to it.

5. Change the permissions on the cache directory (default /usr/local/var/stacks/cache)
so that the user executing the Stacks pipeline will have permissions to write
to the directory.
